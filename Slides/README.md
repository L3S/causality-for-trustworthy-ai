# Presentations

This directory contains all slides we have created to present our survey. In the future, we may add material related to utilizing notions of Causality to improve AI systems.

## Trustworthy AI Lab (L3S Research Center, Hannover)

We had the pleasure of presenting our survey in the Trustworthy AI Lab at the L3S Research Center. We thank everyone involved for allowing us to share our findings with an engaged and knowledgeable audience.
We especially want to thank Cameron Pierson, who allowed us to present our work in his seminar! You can find the material in the "L3S Trustworthy AI Lab" folder.
